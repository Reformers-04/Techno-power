            Towards the end of 2022, OpenAIâ€™s interactive conversational model Chat GPT attracted more than a million
            users in just five days, and triggered a new debate on the opportunities and risks of artificial
            intelligence (AI). With AI spending forecast to exceed $500 billion in 2023, there will be rapid advances in
            adaptive and generative AI Adaptive AI can continuously retrain its models to learn and adapt based on new
            experiences, without needing developers to rebuild it, leading to faster and better outcomes. Generative AI
            uses neural network models to create something new. Recent releases of text-to-image and text-to-video
            generators are appealing to consumers, but also raise significant concerns around the spread of
            disinformation, harmful content, copyright protections and algorithmic biases. Regulators and online
            watchdogs will be looking at this over the coming year.

            Thanks to continual improvements in technology over the past decade, the cost of solar and wind power have
            fallen drastically, making renewables cheaper than fossil fuels. According to some estimates the switch from
            fossil fuels to renewable energy will help economies save $12 trillion globally by 2050.Governments and
            industry leaders will be focusing on scaling existing green technologies and developing new ones in 2023.
            The goal to keep global warming at less than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels seems
            increasingly out of reach, but so do the catastrophic scenarios which were still deemed likely a couple of
            years ago.

            Until recently, CRISPR-Cas9, the gene-editing technology that won its developers the 2020 Nobel Prize in
            Chemistry, has been predominately used as a research tool to understand the importance of specific genes and
            discover new drugs. Since the first person received a gene-editing therapy three years ago, the technology
            has been used to treat congenital blindness, heart disease and sickle cell disease, among others. And while
            primary use-cases are diseases with a single-gene mutation, early research suggests that conditions like
            Alzheimerâ€™s and chronic pain could also be treated with CRISPR.In 2023, we are likely to see an expansion of
            gene editing in medicine, as well as other sectors, powering a multi billion-dollar industry, and posing
            complex ethical dilemmas.

            Quantum computing, which uses subatomic particles to create new ways of processing and storing information,
            promises to be the future of computing. With the promise of operating in orders of magnitude faster than the
            best processors available today, quantum technology will help to solve complex problems in a fraction of the
            time.Although quantum technology is still in its infancy, huge government and industry investment means we
            are likely to see rapid progress in hardware and software in the coming year, as well as quantum products
            starting to come onto the market. At the same time, business and government leaders will step up efforts to
            understand and mitigate the risks the technology poses, from crippling prevailing cryptography to the
            transformation of warfare.

            Economic and geopolitical dynamics are pushing globalization into retreat and propelling the fragmentation
            of cyberspace alongside competing political blocs. However, the structural forces of technological progress
            are moving towards more connectivity, not less. In the coming year, 15 billion devices will be connected
            into the Internet of Things (IoT), and this number is expected to double by 2030. A principal driver of this
            trend will be the rapid expansion of 5G coverage in 2023, which will allow devices to communicate faster and
            improve their overall performance Our dependency on connected devices and infrastructures is growing at an
            exponential pace, and so do the risks of collapse by accident or as the result of an attack. Governments and
            regulators can be expected to step up efforts to ensure that connected devices comply with latest
            cybersecurity standards.
